Hi！Welcome to **那些年，那些事儿** . The general introduction is as follows:

* **Build apps by Flutter:** Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
* **Fast:** Flutter code compiles to ARM or Intel machine code as well as JavaScript, for fast performance on any device.
* **Productive:** Build and iterate quickly with Hot Reload. Update code and see changes almost instantly, without losing state.
* **Flexible**: Control every pixel to create customized, adaptive designs that look and feel great on any screen.
* **Flutter 3**: Deep dive into our [latest release](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-8c74a5bc32d0), including macOS and Linux stable, performance improvements, and more!
